Description
-----------

Let's say you want to build a large application that must,

* Scale to millions of hundreds of user
* Support multiple platforms (Desktop browsers, Mobile browsers and Native mobile applications)
* Handle complex business rules
* Competitive in a fast moving market. React quickly, Out innovate

This talk explores various architectural answers to build such a platform,

* How to apply microservices patterns & anti-patterns to design the right architecture
* Why & how to build a core framework to ensure consistency & manage complexity
* What are the challenges in adopting gRPC for inter-service communication
* How to orchestrate & manage microservices at scale with Kubernetes
* How to leverage Cloud Native ecosystem to move fast & avoid vendor lock-in
