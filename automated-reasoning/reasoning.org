* Reasoning
** Definition attempt
#+begin_quote
Process of jumping from one idea to another
#+end_quote

** An easy example
#+begin_src shell
a + b = a + b
a + b = b + a
#+end_src

Peano numbers. Induction and Commutativity.

** Automating the process

+ Logic Programming. [[https://swish.swi-prolog.org/][Prolog]]

** Retouch
A Premise & A language for walking over ideas.

** An analogy

* Intelligence
** Robbins Conjecture
[[https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html][Computer Math Proof Shows Reasoning Power]] 1996

** Solving mazes

** Intuition
"Nobody knows how humans reason," he said. "When you talk to mathematicians and
say, 'I understand you proved a great theorem. How did you do it?' They'll say,
'Well, I walked around my house a lot and I read some papers and I thought,' "

** Decomposition
+ Perception
+ Reasoning
+ Control
+ Representation
+ Thinking
+ Learning
+ ...

* Humans
** A hard example
Roberto and Saint-Savin. From /The Island of the Day Before/.

** Approximations
"For Coleridge, Shakespeare depicted Hamlet's light of indecisiveness as
resulting from an imbalance between the human attention to external objects, and
inward thoughts, and thus suffered a paralysis of action because his faculty of
vivid imagination overpowered his will and induced an aversion to actually
enacting any measure"

* Directions
+ Explainability and Interpretability and Alignment.
+ Learning and Reasoning. [[https://demo.allennlp.org/textual-entailment][Enforcing abstractions]].

"I want to tell people the real truth of it," Wos said. "If we succeed really
big," he said, giving people hand held thought processors like they now have
hand held numerical calculators, "what an incredible improvement we can make to
their lives."
